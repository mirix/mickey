# mickey

PowerShell script to simulate random mouse clicks.

If you run the script from PowerShell, mouse clicks will happen at random coordinates and intervals while it is running.

It prevents screen saver activation and screen locking.

Certain applications will never show you as being idle.

Useful for micromanaged remote workers.
